Project Description
Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop a robust system that automatically extracts important topics or keywords from questions. This will facilitate quick understanding, categorization, and indexing of queries, which is particularly useful in various applications such as customer support, academic research, and information retrieval systems.

Project Scope:
The project will focus on leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and extract meaningful topics from textual questions. The implementation will involve tokenization, stopword removal, and keyword extraction using the RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm.

Key Features:

Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the input text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization.
Keyword Extraction: Using the RAKE algorithm to identify and rank keywords and phrases based on their importance.
Customization: Allowing adjustments to the RAKE parameters (e.g., stopwords, phrase length, and ranking thresholds) to tailor the keyword extraction process.
Output: Generating a list of key topics or keywords that represent the core elements of the input question.
Technologies Used:

Python: Main programming language for implementation.
NLTK: For text preprocessing, tokenization, and stopword removal.
